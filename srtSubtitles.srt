00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:05,269
Indicates that Docker couldn't pull a Docker image from Amazon ECR,

1
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:06,739
OK,

2
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:10,239
the specific error is a 4 or 3 forbidden response which

3
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:13,600
usually points to an issue with permissions or access rights.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:13,899
OK,

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,640
that's what we thought,

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,430
which is ***.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,729
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,729
Since repositories with ECR are private by default,

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,590
both you and Player A have set up private repositories

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,079
that no-one else can access until you give someone else

11
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:29,739
specific permissions.

12
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:30,020
Yeah,

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,490
*** what we've set up are private repositories,

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,209
my friends.

15
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:36,700
Do you see even in the left-hand navigation panel for Maximus,

16
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:40,470
it's images that highlight a thing is under the heading private registry.

17
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:41,150
***,

18
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:45,569
*** what's really happening here is it's *** private that no one else,

19
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,200
literally no one else can have access until we give it to them specifically.

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,330
And that's the reason why we can just openly paste the

21
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,919
links to our registries in the chat because actually we know

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:56,630
that

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,119
even if you have access to that link,

24
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:00,400
you can't actually get access to

25
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:04,080
the registry itself until we give you specific access.

26
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:07,050
***.

27
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:08,290
Let's take a screenshot,

28
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,129
*** we're gonna go back to our terminal.

29
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,849
And just take a screenshot of this error right here.

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,190
Nice.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,250
And I'm gonna paste that into

32
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:21,760
a box here

33
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,610
and then move on to the next question.
